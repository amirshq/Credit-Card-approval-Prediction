# End-to-End MLOps Project: Credit Card Approval Prediction
# The Project is in Progress and the Code will be Updated Gradually

This project is currently under development. The code and documentation will be updated gradually as the project progresses. Please stay tuned for updates.
## Project Overview

This project aims to build an end-to-end MLOps pipeline for predicting credit card approvals. The pipeline covers all essential steps from data exploration to model deployment. Here’s a comprehensive guide to the project structure and steps involved:

## 1. Introduction

This project is designed to predict whether a credit card application will be approved or not. It includes the following steps:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Defining and training a machine learning model
- Testing and evaluating the model
- Writing a Flask web application for user interaction
- Dockerizing the application
- Deploying the application on a cloud platform

## 3. Data Exploration and Preprocessing

### 3.1 Data Collection
- Dataset is stored in the `data/raw/` directory.
- The dataset includes various features such as ID, gender, car ownership, property ownership, children count, income, education, family status, housing type, days of birth, days employed, etc.

### 3.2 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Conducted in the `01_EDA.ipynb` notebook.
- Includes data cleaning, handling missing values, and feature engineering.
- Visualizations and statistical summaries to understand data distribution and relationships.

### 3.3 Data Preprocessing
- Implemented in `src/data_preprocessing.py`.
- Includes steps such as normalization, encoding categorical variables, and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.

## 4. Model Development

### 4.1 Model Selection
- Various machine learning algorithms are tested including logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests.
- Details can be found in the `02_Model_Development.ipynb` notebook.

### 4.2 Handling Imbalanced Data
- Techniques such as SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) are used to address the class imbalance.

### 4.3 Feature Engineering
- Important features are selected based on correlation analysis and feature importance metrics.

## 5. Model Training, Testing, and Evaluation

### 5.1 Training the Model
- Training scripts are found in `src/model.py`.
- Models are trained on the preprocessed dataset.

### 5.2 Model Evaluation
- Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score are used.
- Confusion matrix and ROC curves are generated.
- Evaluation scripts are in `src/evaluate.py`.

## 6. Flask Web Application

### 6.1 Web Application Development
- A simple web application is developed using Flask (`src/app.py`).
- The application allows users to input data and get predictions on credit card approval.

### 6.2 Testing the Application
- Ensure the Flask app works locally before dockerizing.

## 7. Dockerization

### 7.1 Creating Docker Image
- Dockerfile is provided in the project root.
- Steps to build and run the Docker image are outlined in the Dockerfile.

### 7.2 Running Docker Container
- Instructions to run the container locally and test the Flask application.

## 8. Cloud Deployment

### 8.1 Choosing a Cloud Provider
- The application is deployed on a cloud platform (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud).

### 8.2 Deployment Steps
- Steps to deploy the Docker container on the selected cloud platform.
- Configuration of cloud services for scalable deployment.

## 9. Usage Instructions

### 9.1 Local Setup
1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repository-url>`
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the Flask application locally: `python src/app.py`

### 9.2 Docker Setup
1. Build the Docker image: `docker build -t credit_card_approval .`
2. Run the Docker container: `docker run -p 5000:5000 credit_card_approval`

### 9.3 Cloud Deployment
1. Follow the cloud provider's documentation to deploy the Docker container.
2. Access the application via the provided URL.
